## Week 1 - History Introduction about Text and Writing
- Sumerians in Mesopotamia are credited for inventing writing (Cuneiform)
- Babylonian Number System was a Base-60 System (1-59) based on counting using fingers and knuckles. Symbols: A vertical wedge for "1", a horizontal wedge for '10'
- Early Printing started with Cylinder Seals in Mesopotamia (2600 BC) by rolling clay to leave impressions like a stamp
- Johannes Gutenberg invented a moveable type printing press in Europe around 1450s.
- Johannes Gutenberg used a steel punch to create a copper matix, then poured molten metal into a mold using the matrix
- The Gutenberg Bible was then created in the 1450s to produce Bibles cheaper than handwritten ones. (180 copies printed, ~49 survive)
- The Printing Press impacted the price of books, collapsing them overtime and making them accessible beyond the very wealthy.
- Typewriters were invented in the 19th century, it improved clarity and created legible text in business communication.

## Week 2 - Representing Text and Numbers in Computers
- Binary is a communication of two states. (0,1)
- Morse Code is an earliy binary communication that used short and long beeps/flashes. Invented in the 1840s by Samuel Morse
- Punch Cards: Early data storage method using holes to represent bits.
- Teleprinters: Early devices for sending typed messages over long distances.
- Bit stands for binary digit, represents one of two states (on/off,0/1,true/false,short/long)
- Byte is a standard group of 8 bits
- Volatile memory = Data is lost when power is off (example: RAM)
- Non-Volatile memory = Data persists without power. (Examples: SD cards, HDDs, SSDs)
- A Kilobyte can be both 1000 bytes or 1024 bytes.
- ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange): A table that assigns numbers to letters of the english alphabet and other characters
- Text Editors: Display bytes as characters using ASCII.
- File Structure: Files are sequences of bytes, organized in directories.

## Week 3 - Structure of Text
- Markup languages are used to "mark up" manuscripts to request corrections or specify printing styles
- Markdown: a simple, lightweight markup language. Designed for easy reading and writing in plain text.
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Most common markup language, used for web pages. More verbose than Markdown.
- Special characters are characters that have a meaning or function within a particular language (eg., # in Markdown headings, < in HTML tags)
- Escaping is a mechanism used to tell the interpreter/renderer that a special character should be treated as a literal character, not with its special meaning. (eg., \ in Markdown)
- JSON = A lightweight format for data interchange

## Week 4 - Keyboards and Editors
- Text Editors: One of the most important tools for developers
- Keyboard shortcuts such as Ctrl+F = searching in text, Ctrl+C = copy,
- QWERTY: Most common keyboard layout globally
- Modifier Keys: Ctrl, Shift, Alt, Windows/Command
- Touch typing = typing without looking at the keys
- Text Editors = Notepad, Notepad++, VS Code, Vim. (Not Microsoft Word, thats a word processor)
- IDEs: Integrated Development Environments like WebStorm, Pycharm.
- IDEs Combine a text editor with many other tools for software development (compilers, debuggers, build tools, version control integration, etc.).
- Wildcards: Simple pattern matching, often used in file systems (*.txt, ?a?).
- Regex (Regular Expressions):  A powerful, complex language for describing text patterns. Can look like "line noise" (show the complex email regex example).

## Week 5 - Command Line Interfaces (CLI)
- CLI or "black terminal" = It's an interface where you type commands and the computer responds with text.
- Prompt: The text displayed before you type a command. Often contains useful info: username, computer name, current directory. Example: user@hostname:~/current/directory$
- Command: The instruction you type.
- Response/Output: The text the computer prints after executing the command.
- Cursor: Blinking indicator inviting the next command.
- Functionality: Some tools or features are only available via CLI (cheaper/easier to build CLI tools than GUI).
- Speed: Much faster for certain types of work.
- Precise Control: Allows specifying details down to the tiniest level.
- Automation: Commands are lines of text. Can easily create scripts (text files of commands) to automate repetitive tasks.
- Remote Work (SSH): Works extremely well over networks, even slow ones, due to low bandwidth requirements (sending text commands and receiving text replies).
- Secure Shell: Primary tool for connecting to remote computers over a network. Communication is encrypted for privacy.
- How to open for Mac OS: cmd + space -> type "Terminal" -> Enter
- How to open for Windows: Start Menu -> Search bar -> Type "terminal", "cmd", or "powershell"
- CLI Command structure: General format: command [subcommand] [options/flags] [arguments]
- Command: The main program name (e.g., ls, cat, cd)
- Subcommand: Some complex tools have subcommands (e.g., git add, git commit).
- Options/Flags: Modify command behavior. Start with - (short form, e.g., -l, -a) or -- (long form, e.g., --long, --all). Can often combine short options (ls -la).
- Arguments: The inputs the command operates on (e.g., filenames, directory names). cat readme (readme is the argument).
